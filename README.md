# VuePlayground

**VuePlayground** is a test project created to explore and familiarize myself with the fundamental concepts of Vue.js. The project serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with Vue's core features, such as components, directives, state management, routing, and more.

This application is a simple demonstration where I applied various Vue.js concepts to build a basic app. It is not intended for production use, but rather as a learning tool to better understand the framework.

## ✨ What I Learned

- **Components**: How to create and use reusable components.
- **Directives**: Working with Vue's built-in directives such as `v-bind`, `v-for`, `v-if`, etc.
- **State Management**: Managing local state within components and passing data between them.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user input and events within Vue components.
- **Vue Router**: Basic routing to navigate between different views in the application.
- **Vue CLI**: Using the Vue CLI to set up and structure a Vue project.
